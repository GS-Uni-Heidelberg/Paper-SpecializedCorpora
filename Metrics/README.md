# Experimenting with Query Expansion Methods
With the code in this directory, the corpus linguistic metrics were evaluated. 

If you replicated our corpus with the data dir, you can replicate all numbers and figures from the paper with the `Replicate.ipynb` notebook.

It's also possible to apply the methods to your own corpus. Corpora should be in the following format:
+ A directory with JSON files
+ Each JSON file contains at least the key 'lemmas' under which a list of strings -- the lemmatized document -- is stored, and ideally, some metadata, e.g. classifications for evaluation.

If you tweak `load_data.py` and / or `corpus.py` in the `src/` dir, you can also use other formats.

In `wordlists/queries` you can find the queries generated by the different methods e.g. for qualitative evaluation.
