# Handle Annotations
With the code in this directory, the individual annotations were added to the corpus documents and the the gold labels were produced from that data (using a Dawid-Skene model).

You can also check the inter-rater reliability.

In order for the Dawid-Skene-Model to run, you must download the code from [HERE](https://github.com/kajyuuen/Dawid-skene/blob/master/dawid_skene_model.py).
