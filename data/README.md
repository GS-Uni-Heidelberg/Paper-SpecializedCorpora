# Data / Corpus
Due to copyright reasons, the articles used for this paper can obviously not be published.

However, you can replicate the data with the `.csv` file in this directory. `articles.csv` contains data on:
+ The URLs of all the articles that comprise the corpus - if you scrape these pages, you can mostly recreate the corpus (although web text is obviously subject to change)
+ The labels given to the articles by each annotator, and the gold labels
+ LLM labels
+ Article metadata
